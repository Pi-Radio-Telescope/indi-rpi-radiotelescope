# indi-rpi-radiotelescope

This is a Instrument-Neutral-Device-Interface (INDI) driver intended to run on Raspberry Pi 
and providing all functionality of a Az/Alt mount by interacting with SSI-based positional
encoders via SPI interface and controlling GPIO pins for motor controls and digital
inputs/outputs. This driver is developed for a dedicated DIY mount for a 3m radio telescope.
